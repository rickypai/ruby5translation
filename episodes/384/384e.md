###Declutter Lib
####Kuba Suder wrote a blog post on how to declutter the lib directory in Rails apps based on his experience cleaning up his own.

C: So Nate, if one most look under the `lib` folder on your current Rails project, how many different files would be define?

N: Oh I don't even know..

C: ..and I don't blame you. Rails has a pretty well defined directory structure for Models, View, Controllers, and more recently Assets, Mailer as well. But the `lib` folder has always been solved the place just shows about anything that doesn't follow into Rails create for you. For this reason, Kuba Suder wrote a blog post on how to declutter the `lib` directory, based on his experience cleaning up his own.

N: Oh cool, so what does he told me that I can do to clean up the `lib` folder?

C: He mentions everything that relates to your app should be out of `lib` and under the `app` folder.

N: All right, so maybe things like Decorators, Presenters, Service objects, Back ground jobs, those should be maybe going in that like the sub folder in the `app`?

C: Exactly, and also Rails4 now creates `app/models/concern`, `app/controllers/concern` folder which should be used from modules and tend to be mixed in to another classes.

N: All right. So what can stand `lib` then?

C: According to Kuba, the `lib` directory should contain only those files that the generic and could be reusable another projects. Examples are interfaces to external web services, Database tools, Extensions to core Ruby classes, and basically anything that could be extracted into its own Ruby gem. So check out the blog post for more information and full basic guideline for keeping `lib` folder clean.

###Puma vs. Passenger
####The guys from Phusion wrote up a very detailed article comparing their Phusion Passenger app server with Puma. It goes over multiple aspects, like concurrency, deployment models, performance for both CPU and I/O ­bound applications, memory usage, management tools, garbage collection, debugging, fault­ tolerance, resource control, documentation and runtime support.

N: The guys from Phusion wrote up a very detailed article comparing their Phusion Passenger app server with Puma.

C: Wait, wait, You're saying that that did not include my all time favorite server, WEBrick in there? Come on.

N: No, we're actually talking about real app servers here.

C: All right, so what does the article say?

N: It goes so far well tons of aspect about these application servers. For example, like a how each handles concurrency in different thread pool strategy where Puma dynamic thread pool over sees Passenger static but a opitimy star pool. then maybe the deployment Passenger, you know, usually been integrate directory in the web server like patch nginx, but Puma takes a like over proxy approch listens on TCP circuit, UNIX circuit for HTTP requests, and there are a lot more stuff its covered. You're talking thins like Performance for CPU over I/O-bound applications, Memory usage, Management tools, Garbage collection, Debugging, Fault-tolerance, Resource control, Documentation, and even Runtime support. Definitely, check out the article.

###Exception Notification 4.0
####Sebastian Martinez has recently released version 4.0 of the Exception Notification gem. The new version includes bug fixes, support for sidekiq and resque, better logging for notification errors and it's Rails 4 compatible. It also adds email and campfire notifiers, support for Webhooks, custom notifiers and it introduces a couple of changes the configuration API.

C: Sebastian Martinez has recently released version 4.0 of the `exception_notification` gem.

N: This is the gem that notifies you an error occurs in Rack or Rails application and sends them over email or campfire notification. So what's new 4.0?

C: There are some bug fixes and a bunch of enhancements like support for `sidekiq` and `resque`, better logging for notification errors and it's Rails 4 compatible.

N: Nice. I like myself some Rails quattro.

C: There's more, in addition to existing email and campfire notifiers, there's now support Webhooks where you give a URL to post new notifications to, and also custom notifiers which basically Ruby objects respond to call. This new 4.0 version now also changes the configuration API. So check out the project documentation for more information.

###Ettu generates smarter ETags
####The Ettu gem transparently adds your view templates, JavaScript and CSS files into the Rails ­generated ETag equation.

C: The guys over Cloud space recently released the `ettu` gem which transparently adds your view templates, JavaScript and CSS files into the Rails ­generated ETag equation.

N: Why does it do that?

C: Oh well, OK so ETags are used a client browser as know quickly wanna as pay change, or more importantly not change. and allows the bypass network load time for contentally have by responding with through ??? modify. And network really seems in ??? really well, add web server level static files, but if you won't your non-dynamic Rails and points to the same, you might have a problem.

N: Oh I see, so like I wanna pass ActiveRecord object to refresh when call my controller.

C: Right, Rails calls object cash key method to generate ETag and completely bypasses any view code like Template Assets, it gives you a performance advantage but it might cause some issues download.

N: Oh because well my database data might not have changed, maybe my CSS did, and ETag doesn't represent it well by default.

C: Exactly, if you change your CSS or Javascript and then deployed, you might have a problem. You can run to an issue where your visitors are trying to pull down all assets don't exists any more or because ETag ???? page thought it had was a same. And that's still using old assets.

N: So how do I use this 'ettu' and what is the syntax?

C: It doesn't effect fresh one syntax at all. You just keep using fresh one the way you use to. So simply adding the gem `ettu` to `Gemfile`, does it for you.

###Octopus 0.6.0 was released
####The Octopus gem allows you to do Database Sharding in ActiveRecord and they just released version 0.6.0. A couple of different things are new in this version, like some refactorings and clean ups, removal of the Octopus::Logger, using the MySQL2 Driver instead of MySQL for the spec suite and, most importantly dropping support for Rails 2.x. If you need Rails 2, then Octopus 0.5 is the latest version that you can use. Octopus 0.6 is Rails 3 only and the not­-yet-­released Octopus 0.7 is planning to support Rails 4.

N: Have you heard of `Octopus`?

C: I've heard of `Octopus` and I like the way taste.

N: Well, Not the type of I'm taking about. The what I'm talking about is `octopus` gem that allows you to do Database sharing in ActiveRecord. and they just released version 0.6.0 .

C: Database sharing, that's when you use different database servers all within one application.

N: Yes, and modern several projects out there that implement sharing, DbCharmer, DataFabric, MultiDb, each project has its own limitations. The mingle of `octopus` is provide better way of doing database sharing through way simple API.

C: Oh nice, so what's new in this version?

N: A couple of different things, like some refactorings and clean ups, the removal of the Octopus::Logger, using the MySQL2 Driver instead of MySQL for the spec suite and, most importantly dropping support for Rails 2. If you need Rails 2, then Octopus 0.5 is the latest version that you can use. Octopus 0.6 is Rails 3 only and the not­-yet-­released Octopus 0.7 is planning to support Rails 4. So check out the project page for more details.

###The self-pipe trick
####Jesse Storrimer wrote an article on RubySource in which he shows a couple of caveats when working with UNIX signals and how you can solve them using a trick called the self­-pipe.

C: Jesse Storrimer wrote an article on RubySource in which he shows a couple of caveats when working with UNIX signals and how you can solve them using a trick called the self­-pipe.

N: So what are the caveats?

C: All right, so because UNIX signals can interapt program anytime that is potensial what one signal
's been handled, another signal can alive in another first handler. This can often lay the bugs that can crush a program.

N: And how could we solve this?

C: Well, Jesse shows how both `foreman` and `unicorn` solve this by using global queue, which takes a logic out of signal handler blocks and further back in the main loop.

N: Done, problem solved, let's ship it.

C: Not so fast. A rest of issue actually raise another issue, which is potencial raise condition that can only `foreman` to effectively ignore requests terminate process and manages.

N: Oh no, how can that solve raise condition?

C: Oh well, He shows how you can solve this by using what's called the solve pipe, which is IO pipe that is not share within your processes. It's unlikely only impliment that most of Ruby projects, but the post is great read self indencation how trikky can be handled signal process properly.

N: And an indication that how we should be thinkful for having smart people on the community taking care of these issues for us.
